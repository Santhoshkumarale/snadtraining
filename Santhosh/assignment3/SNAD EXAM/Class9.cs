   //1     call by value: Call by value method copies the value of an argument into the formal parameter of that function.Therefore, changes made to the parameter of the main function do not affect the argument.
    //call by reference: Call by reference method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. In this method, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the function call.It means that changes made in the parameter alter the passing argument.


   // 6      Abstract Class: It has both declaration and definition part.A class can use only one abstract class. Abstract class contains methods fields and constants.Multiple inheritance is not achieved by abstract class.
//Interface: It contains only a declaration part.Multiple inheritance is achieved by interface. It can only contain methods, properties, indexers, events.


//7.  Method overloading: It is defined as the creating multiple methods in a class and with same names but with different parameters.
     //Method overriding: It is defined as the creating with multiple methods in a class with same names and same parameters but one should be in base class and another should be in child class.
